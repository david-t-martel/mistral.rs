message: Do not create duplicate files with prefixes like enhanced_, simple_, or improved_. Always edit the canonical version.

  any:
    - pattern: fs::write("enhanced_$NAME", $CONTENT)
    - pattern: fs::write("simple_$NAME", $CONTENT)
    - pattern: fs::write("improved_$NAME", $CONTENT)
    - pattern: File::create("enhanced_$NAME")

note: This violates the canonical file editing rule. Edit the original file directly.
