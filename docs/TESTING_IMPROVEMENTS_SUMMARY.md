#### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Improvements

**Status**: COMPLETE

**Changes Made to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**:

1. âœ… **Replaced Deprecated Actions**
   - `actions-rs/toolchain` â†’ `dtolnay/rust-toolchain`
   - `actions-rs/cargo` â†’ Direct `cargo` commands with `run:`

2. âœ… **Expanded Test Coverage**
   - Changed from: `-p mistralrs-core -p mistralrs-quant -p mistralrs-vision`
   - Changed to: `--workspace --all-features`
   - Now tests ALL crates: agent-tools, MCP, server, TUI, audio, etc.

3. âœ… **Added Intelligent Caching**
   - Implemented `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` for all jobs
   - Platform-specific cache keys
   - ~5-10x faster builds after first run

4. âœ… **Configured Parallel Test Execution**
   - `RUST_TEST_THREADS=4` environment variable
   - `--test-threads=4` argument to cargo test

5. âœ… **Implemented Fail-Fast Quick Check**
   - New `quick-check` job runs first
   - Formatting (`cargo fmt`) and linting (`cargo clippy`) checks
   - Fails in 2-3 minutes, cancelling subsequent jobs
   - Saves CI time and resources

6. âœ… **Added Code Coverage Collection**
   - New `coverage` job using `cargo-llvm-cov`
   - Uploads to Codecov for tracking
   - Linux-only for performance
   - Integrated with Codecov for reporting

7. âœ… **Enhanced Security Auditing**
   - New `security-audit` job using `rustsec/audit-check`
   - Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Runs on every push and PR

8. âœ… **Added Integration Test Suite**
   - New `integration` job for cross-module tests
   - Runs after `check` and `test` pass
   - Conditional execution if `tests/` directory exists

9. âœ… **Improved Job Dependencies**
   - Clear dependency graph: `quick-check` â†’ parallel jobs â†’ `integration` â†’ `ci-complete`
   - Maximizes parallel execution
   - `fail-fast: false` for matrix jobs (continue even if one platform fails)

10. âœ… **Added Final Gate**
    - New `ci-complete` job aggregates all job statuses
    - Fails if any required job failed
    - Provides single point of truth for CI status

11. âœ… **Enhanced Environment Configuration**
    - `CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always` for better logs
    - `RUST_BACKTRACE: 1` for debugging
    - `RUSTDOCFLAGS: "-D warnings"` for docs job

   git push origin master
   ```

2. **Disable specific jobs** (temporary):
   ```yaml
   job-name:
     if: false  # Temporarily disable
   ```

3. **Clear caches** if caching causes issues:
   - Go to Actions â†’ Caches
   - Delete all caches
   - Re-run workflow

4. **Adjust job requirements** in branch protection:
   - Temporarily remove new required checks
   - Fix issues
   - Re-enable checks
