## File Count Reduction

| Phase         | Before               | After   | Reduction         |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Current State | 45 files             | -       | -                 |
| After Phase 1 | 42 files             | -3      | 7%                |
| After Phase 2 | 38 files             | -7      | 16%               |
| After Phase 3 | 34 files             | -11     | 24%               |
| After Phase 4 | 34 files (organized) | -11     | 24%               |
| **Final**     | **34 active files**  | **-11** | **24% reduction** |

**Plus**: 4 archived scripts preserved for reference

**Note**: Reduction is conservative because we're preserving all unique functionality and cross-platform scripts. The main benefit is **organization** and **elimination of duplication**, not aggressive deletion.

______________________________________________________________________

## Scripts That MUST NOT Change

These scripts are critical and must remain unchanged:

1. ‚úÖ **Makefile** - Mandatory build system (per CLAUDE.md)
1. ‚úÖ **Makefile.toml** - Performance optimization
1. ‚úÖ **derive-utils/Makefile** - Required by main Makefile
1. ‚úÖ **deploy/WinUtils-Deployment-Framework.ps1** - Production deployment
1. ‚úÖ **deploy/WinUtils-Manager.ps1** - Production management
1. ‚úÖ **scripts/install/**\* - All installation scripts
1. ‚úÖ **scripts/packages/**\* - All packaging scripts
1. ‚úÖ **coreutils/scripts/**\* - Coreutils sub-project scripts
1. ‚úÖ **benchmarks/scripts/**\* - Benchmarking framework

______________________________________________________________________

## Summary

- **Total Scripts**: 45 files (142 KB + 1,784 lines)
- **To Delete**: 7 files (empty, broken, duplicates)
- **To Archive**: 4 files (obsolete development tools)
- **To Reorganize**: 5 files (better directory structure)
- **To Keep Unchanged**: 29 files (production systems)

**Result**: Cleaner, more maintainable build automation with zero loss of functionality.
